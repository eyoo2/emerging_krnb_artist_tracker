# emerging_krnb_artist_tracker
The Emerging KR&amp;B Artist Tracker is a dashboard that displays the top 15 emerging Korean R&amp;B artists based on weekly Spotify follower count and popularity score data. The dashboard is run via 2 Python DAGs (directed acyclic graph) which are executed using Apache Airflow and the Spotify WebAPI on your local machine.
